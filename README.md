# ASSISTments-Data-Mining-Competition-2017
Overview: This competition is sponsored by the Big Data for Education Spoke of the Northeast Big Data Hub, an NSF initiative to help spur progress in educational research using big data.  Individuals/teams competing in this research will use educational data from ASSISTments, an intelligent tutoring system of middle school mathematics, to make long term predictions, and winners will be asked to publish their work in the Journal of Educational Data Mining. 

Long term outcome being modeled: The task in this competition is to develop a cross-validated prediction model that is able to use middle-school data to predict whether the students (who have now finished college) pursue a career in STEM fields (1) or not (0).

Dataset:

By downloading our dataset, using our dataset, registering to the competition, and/or submitting predictions, you have agreed to our Terms of Use. 

The dataset for this competition, in which you will predict which students have entered STEM career feels (and which haven't), includes these 12 files:    

student_log_#.csv (9 files), which contain the logged activity data from students' interactions with assistments ASSISTments
training_label.csv, which contains some student-level data and the dependent measure for the training set: isSTEM.
validation_test_label.csv contains some student-level data but not the dependent measure for the validation and test set
